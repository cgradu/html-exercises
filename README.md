# Odin-Web-Design
In this project I am learning the main use cases and functionalities of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the help of the open-source project:
"The Odin Project"

To open <file-name>.html files you have to use the following command:
    open <file-name>.html

For an easier preview of the project, all the html files can be run by running the "open_sites.sh" script with the following command:
    sh open_sites.sh
